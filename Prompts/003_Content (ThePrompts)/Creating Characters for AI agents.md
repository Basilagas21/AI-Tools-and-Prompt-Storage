- **Source:** Notion's AI Agents
- **Goal:** create Ai agents mascots and make sure they're animated too
- **Notes:** 

## Prompt


```
Based on the images, these are Notions's new agents where they have their own roles to serve for the user to solve specific problems. Now, I'm more interested in the design of these agents as shown in the image. And these agents in the images are animated. For example, in the corner of Notion, they will make animations such as expressions, actions, moving and jumping when interacting with the user. I want the design but i dont know where to start. i dont even know what the design term or concept as shown and as explained when I show u these images for me to get them. i also want the animation for it
```

### Final Images



Based on the images, the design concept you're looking for is likely related to **"character design"** or **"mascot design,"** specifically in a minimalist or abstract style. The agents are essentially brand mascots for different functions within Notion.

The design style can be described as:

- **Minimalist Line Art:** The core of the face (eyes and nose) is created with simple black lines.
    
- **Abstract/Geometric:** The face is not a realistic representation but an abstract arrangement of simple shapes. The eyes are small circles, the nose is a bent line, and the eyebrows/glasses are curved or straight lines.
    
- **Modular/Component-based:** The design is built from a few interchangeable components. The eyes and nose are static, while the "accessories" like eyebrows, glasses, or hats change to represent different agent personalities. This modularity makes it easy to create variations.
    
- **"Human-like" but not Human:** The design evokes a human face without being detailed or lifelike, which makes it friendly and approachable.
    

The animation style you've described sounds like **"Lottie"** or **"SVG animation."** These are vector-based animations that are lightweight and scalable. This type of animation is perfect for simple, character-based interactions on a web or mobile interface.

To get started on creating your own designs and animations in this style, you can use these terms as a starting point for your research and learning:

**For the Design:**

- **Minimalist character design**
    
- **Abstract logo design**
    
- **Line art mascot**
    
- **Modular character design**
    
- **Simple emoji/icon design**
    

**For the Animation:**

- **Lottie animation** (popular for app and web UIs)
    
- **SVG animation** (for creating scalable vector graphics that can be animated)
    
- **After Effects to Lottie** (a common workflow for designers)
    
- **Principle for Mac** (for creating interactive UI animations)
    

**Where to Start:**

1. **Sketching:** Start by sketching out simple variations of the core face (eyes and nose).
    
2. **Digital Design:** Use a vector-based design program like **Adobe Illustrator, Figma, or Sketch** to create the final, scalable designs. Focus on getting the simple lines and shapes right.
    
3. **Animation:**
    
    - **Simple approach:** Use a tool like **Figma's Smart Animate** to create basic state changes (e.g., from one expression to another).
        
    - **Advanced approach:** Learn **Adobe After Effects** with the **LottieFiles plugin**. This is the industry standard for creating the kind of smooth, interactive animations you see in the images. You would import your vector assets and then animate them. The plugin exports the animation as a Lottie file, which a developer can easily integrate into a website or app.
        
    - **Web-based tools:** Explore online animation tools like **LottieFiles** or **Spline** that allow you to create and export animations directly.
        

By searching for these specific terms, you'll find tutorials, articles, and inspiration that align with the aesthetic and technical requirements of the Notion agents.

now i want a design where it looks like Jinwow's army.
```

Okay, that's a fantastic concept! Jinwoo's army from "Solo Leveling" is known for its distinct shadowy, imposing, and often monstrous aesthetic. We'll need to blend that powerful, dark fantasy feel with the minimalist, abstract style of the Notion agents.

Here's a breakdown of how we can approach designing a Notion-style agent inspired by Jinwoo's shadow army, along with a visual example:

**Core Design Principles from Jinwoo's Army:**

1. **Shadow/Darkness:** The most defining characteristic. Everything is dark, shadowy, and often appears as if conjured from darkness itself.
    
2. **Imposing Silhouettes:** Even though they are minimalist, they should feel powerful and slightly intimidating.
    
3. **Monstrous/Demonic Features:** Horns, sharp teeth/jaws, glowing eyes (often red or blue), claws, spiky elements.
    
4. **Loyalty/Controlled Power:** They are an army, so there's a sense of order and controlled strength.
    
5. **Variations:** Just like Jinwoo's army has different types of shadows (Igris, Beru, tank-type, mage-type), we can have subtle variations in the minimalist design.
    

**Integrating with Notion Agent Style (Minimalist & Abstract):**

- **Keep the "Face" Structure:** Retain the core abstract face (eyes and nose) as the base.
    
- **Monochromatic/Limited Palette:** Stick to black, white, and perhaps a single accent color (like a deep red or electric blue for eyes/glow).
    
- **Shadowy "Accessories":** Instead of cowboy hats or ducks, we'll add elements that evoke the shadow army.
    

**Let's design one example: A "Shadow Soldier" agent.**

**Concept:** A basic shadow soldier, perhaps with a subtle helmet-like shape or horns, and glowing eyes.

Here is a design for a Notion-style agent inspired by Jinwoo's Shadow Army, specifically a basic "Shadow Soldier" type. It maintains the minimalist aesthetic while incorporating key elements of the shadow army's look.

Absolutely! Here's a design for a Notion-style agent inspired by Jinwoo's Shadow Army, specifically a basic "Shadow Soldier" type. It aims to capture the essence of a shadow minion while adhering to the minimalist, abstract style of the Notion agents.

Here's a concept for a **"Shadow Minion" agent** in the Notion style:

![[SimpleShadowMascot_2.png|300]]

```
I dont want them to look to similiar. Give me onw taht looks like a knight, a bear, a dragon, an Orgre and one ant looking thing. As long as i want them to look distinct from each other but give me the animation and expression of them. If can, add more characters if u can, so be as creative as you want
```

This is a fantastic challenge! Combining the minimalist Notion agent style with the distinct, powerful aesthetics of Jinwoo's Shadow Army creatures, each with unique animations and expressions, will be really fun.

The key will be to identify the most iconic and recognizable features of each creature and translate them into simple, abstract forms that fit within the circular agent icon, while still maintaining that shadowy, ethereal glow.

For each, I'll describe the design concept, suggest an expression/animation, and then provide the image.

### Design Principles for Jinwoo's Army Agents:

- **Core Face:** Still the abstract eyes and nose, but they'll be integrated into the shadow forms.
    
- **Shadowy Form:** The main "body" or helmet will be a deep, dark silhouette.
    
- **Glowing Eyes:** A consistent feature, likely an electric blue or purple, to signify their magical nature and connection to Jinwoo.
    
- **Distinctive Features:** Horns, ears, armor plates, wings, mandibles – simplified to be instantly recognizable.
    
- **Minimalist Detail:** No excessive lines; rely on silhouette and key features.
    
- **Dynamic Poses/Expressions:** Even in a static image, try to imply movement or a characteristic emotion.

Let's conjure them!

### 1. Shadow Knight (Inspired by Igris)

**Revised Design Concept:** We will emphasize the strong, broad shoulders, the distinct helmet shape with its prominent central crest, and clear, sharp lines that suggest segmented armor rather than a cloth mask. The eyes will maintain their intense glow, peering from within the armored visor.

**Animation/Expression:** A resolute, unyielding gaze. The glowing eyes could have a very slight, rhythmic pulse. When idle, perhaps a subtle shift in the shoulder plates, as if ready to move. When confirming an action, a firm, decisive dip and rise of the helmet.

Here is the refined Shadow Knight, designed to clearly evoke a knight from the reference image:

![[Igris.png | 300]]

### 2. Shadow Bear (Inspired by Tank)

**Design Concept:** A bulky, powerful silhouette. We'll give it rounded, strong shoulders and small, characteristic bear ears. The face will have a slightly wider, more imposing feel.

**Animation/Expression:** A stoic, "unmovable" presence. When idle, maybe a slow, deep breath animation where its bulk subtly expands and contracts. When acknowledging, a small, powerful "grunt" (visualized as a subtle head lower and lift).

![[Kumo.png | 300]]

### 3. Shadow Dragon (Inspried by Kamesh)

**Design Concept:** For the dragon, we'll emphasize a powerful, serpentine, or reptilian head. Think sharp, angular horns/spikes and a slightly elongated face. Its menacing nature should come through even in simplicity.

**Animation/Expression:** A slow, deliberate blink of its glowing eyes, or a subtle "smoke" effect curling from its nostrils (visualized as faint wisps of shadow). When prompted, a slight, slow turn of its head, as if surveying its domain.

![[Kamesh.png|300]]
### 4. Shadow Ogre (Tusk and Tank)

**Design Concept:** The Ogre needs to convey brute strength and a more monstrous, less refined appearance than the Knight. We'll give it a heavy brow, blunt horns or tusks, and a craggy, powerful silhouette.

**Animation/Expression:** A slow, heavy nod, conveying a somewhat dull but loyal understanding. Perhaps a subtle, deep rumble (visualized as a slight tremor or puff of shadow from its lower face) when thinking or ready to act.

![[Kentor.png|300]]

### 5. Shadow Assassin (Created by Accident but Cool af)


**Quick note: The result of this is actually the second time I ask Gemini to properly generate Igris. The result looked cool so I thought, I might as well keep him.**

**Revised Design Concept:** We will emphasize the strong, broad shoulders, the distinct helmet shape with its prominent central crest, and clear, sharp lines that suggest segmented armor rather than a cloth mask. The eyes will maintain their intense glow, peering from within the armored visor.

**Animation/Expression:** A resolute, unyielding gaze. The glowing eyes could have a very slight, rhythmic pulse. When idle, perhaps a subtle shift in the shoulder plates, as if ready to move. When confirming an action, a firm, decisive dip and rise of the helmet.
