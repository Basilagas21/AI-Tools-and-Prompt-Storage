# AI & Prompt Knowledge Base

Welcome to a meticulously organized digital brain for AI exploration, built with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). This repository serves as a personal knowledge management (PKM) system to catalog AI tools and craft high-quality prompts. It's designed not just for storage, but for active learning and creation.

Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a developer, or a creative professional, this system provides a scalable framework to harness the power of artificial intelligence.

## The Philosophy

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, staying organized is key. This vault is built on the principle of a flexible, interconnected web of knowledge. Instead of rigid hierarchies, it uses a combination of structured directories and dynamic linking, allowing information to be both organized and discoverable in multiple contexts.

## Core Components

This vault is split into two primary domains:

1.  **`/AI/`**: A comprehensive encyclopedia of AI tools and technologies.
2.  **`/Prompts/`**: A powerful and scalable system for developing, storing, and managing AI prompts.

## `/AI/` — The AI Encyclopedia

This directory is your personal atlas of the AI world. It's designed to systematically document and explore the capabilities of various AI tools, from well-known platforms to niche applications.

### How It Works

The structure encourages a methodical approach to learning about and categorizing AI.

-   **`001_Tools/`**: Contains notes on the software, libraries, or platforms that *support* your AI workflows. Think of this as the toolbox for your workshop.
-   **`002_AI categories/`**: This is the taxonomy system. Notes here define different categories of AI (e.g., "Generative Art," "Large Language Models," "AI-Powered Audio Tools") to create a structured overview of the landscape.
-   **`003_Content (TheAIs)/`**: The heart of the encyclopedia. Each note in this folder is a detailed profile of a specific AI tool, covering its features, use cases, and your personal findings.
-   **`004_SampleOfAIs/`**: A gallery of outputs. This folder is for showcasing concrete examples of what the AIs can do, providing inspiration and a tangible reference for their capabilities.
-   **`099_Templates/`**: Consistency is key. This folder holds templates for creating new entries for AI tools, ensuring that each profile is comprehensive and uniformly structured.
-   **`100_Reference/`**: Your learning hub. This is where you store articles, research papers, tutorials, and other reference materials that deepen your understanding of AI.

## `/Prompts/` — The Prompt Engineering Lab

This is more than just a folder of text files; it's a sophisticated system for prompt management. Leveraging the power of Obsidian and the Dataview plugin, it transforms a simple collection of prompts into a dynamic, queryable database.

### How It Works

This system is designed for flexibility and power, allowing you to find the perfect prompt when you need it.

-   **`001_Tools/`**: Notes on tools that assist in prompt engineering, such as prompt builders or optimizers.
-   **`002_Prompt Categories/`**: Similar to the AI directory, this provides a high-level organization of prompt types (e.g., "Creative Writing," "Code Generation," "Marketing Copy").
-   **`003_Content (ThePrompts)/`**: The central repository for all your prompts. Each prompt is a separate note, tagged for easy retrieval.
-   **`004_SampleOfPrompts/`**: A portfolio of your best work. This folder links prompts to their generated outputs, creating a valuable feedback loop for refining your prompt engineering skills.
-   **`099_Templates/`**: Contains templates for structuring new prompts, ensuring they include necessary metadata like tags, parameters, and target AI models.
-   **`100_Reference/`**: Stores guides, articles, and best practices on the art and science of prompt engineering.

> **A Note on a Smarter Workflow**
> The true power of this system is detailed in `Prompts/README.file Prompt Storage.md`. It explains how to use Obsidian's tagging system and the **Dataview plugin** to create dynamic dashboards that automatically organize and display your prompts based on their categories, making your collection instantly searchable and browsable without ever having to move a file.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Download this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Open as an Obsidian Vault**: Open Obsidian and select "Open folder as vault." Choose the cloned repository's directory.
3.  **Install Recommended Plugins**: For the full experience, especially for the `Prompts` section, install the [Dataview plugin](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) from the Obsidian Community Plugins browser.
4.  **Start Populating**: Use the templates in the `099_Templates` folders to begin adding your own AI tools and prompts.

This system is designed to grow with you. Customize the categories, refine the templates, and build the ultimate personal AI knowledge base.
